h1. !http://railsapps.github.com/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails Composer)! Rails Composer

An application template that creates a Rails 3.2 starter app.

See "the Rails Composer project page":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer.

It's the Rails generator on steroids.

h2. Creating a Starter App

To build a Rails application, run the command (where @myapp@ is the name of your application):

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

You can use the @-T@ flag to skip Test::Unit files or the @-O@ flag to skip Active Record files:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb -T -O
</pre>

h2. Your Options

</pre>

h2. Run the Application

Switch to the application root directory to examine and test what you've built.

<pre>
$ cd myapp
</pre>

h4. Quick Test

For a "smoke test" to see if everything runs, display a list of Rake tasks.

<pre>
$ rake -T
</pre>

There's no need to run @bundle exec rake@ instead of @rake@ when you are using rvm (see "rvm and bundler integration":https://rvm.io/integration/bundler/).

h4. Start the Web Server

If you've chosen WEBrick or Thin for your web server, can run the app by entering the command:

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

For the Unicorn web server:

@$ unicorn@

See the app at "http://localhost:8080/":http://localhost:8080.

For the Puma web server:

@$ rails server puma@

See the app at "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

h4. Login

If you've created a version of the application that sets up a default user, log in with:

* email: user@example.com
* password: please

You should delete or change any pre-configured logins before you deploy your application.

h2. Testing

Some versions of the starter application will contain a suite of RSpec unit tests or Cucumber scenarios and step definitions.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.

Run @rake spec@ to run all RSpec tests.

Run @rake cucumber@ (or more simply, @cucumber@) to run all Cucumber scenarios.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you can contribute improved RSpec or Cucumber files.

h2. Deployment

For easy deployment, use a “platform as a service” provider such as:

* "Heroku":http://www.heroku.com/
* "CloudFoundry":http://www.cloudfoundry.com/
* "EngineYard":http://www.engineyard.com/
* "OpenShift":https://openshift.redhat.com/app/

For deployment on Heroku, see the article:

* "Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html

h2. Application Template Default

The @rails new@ command creates a new Rails application. If you want to use the Rails Composer application template for every Rails application you build, you can set options for the @rails new@ command in a *.railsrc* file in your home directory. Here's how to set up a *.railsrc* file to use the template when you create a new Rails application:

<pre>
# ~/.railsrc
-m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

h2. Troubleshooting

Problems? Check the "issues for the rails_apps_composer gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/issues.

You should review the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html to make sure you've updated all the components that are required to run Rails successfully.

h4. Problems with  "Certificate Verify Failed"

Are you getting an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" when you try to generate a new Rails app from an application template? See suggestions to resolve the error "Certificate Verify Failed":http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

h4. Problems with "Segmentation Fault"

If you get a "segfault" when you try @rails new@, try removing and reinstalling rvm.

h2. Documentation and Support

The Rails Composer application template is assembled from recipes supplied by the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem. See the rails_apps_composer project to understand how the Rails Composer application works.

h4. Customizing the Template

If you wish to change the template to generate an app with your own customized options, you can copy and edit the template file. However, it is better to use the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem to create a new application template. You'll find newer versions of the recipes that make up the application template. You may find issues have been identified and (perhaps) fixed. And it will be easier to maintain your application template if you work from the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html.
